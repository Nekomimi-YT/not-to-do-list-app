## not-to-do-list-app

NOT To-Do lists are used often in coaching to help clients focus on change.  In Germany, the Not To-Do List is also associated with the comedic Kangaroo Chronicles by author and musician Marc-Uwe Kling:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kangaroo_Chronicles 

This project creates a basic NOT To-Do-List app using jQuery with the following features:

The user can:
1. Add a new item to a list of items.
2. Cross out an item from the list of items.
3. Delete an item from the list of items.
4. Change the order of items in the list of items.

Regular javascript is included in the comments below the code.
